Cloning the Auth Boilerplate
    - lecture uses the MEN Stack Auth Template as starter code
        - doing so allows us to have a connection established to our MongoDB Atlas, add functioning auth for our user model, and install some of the packages we will need for our app build
        -  https://git.generalassemb.ly/modular-curriculum-all-courses/men-stack-session-auth-template
    > navigate to the MEN Stack Auth Template and clone the repository
        git clone https://git.generalassemb.ly/modular-curriculum-all-courses/men-stack-session-auth-template.git open-house

        - by adding the open-house argument we're cloning the specified repo into a directory called open-house on our machines
    > cd into your renamed directory
        cd open-house
    > remove the existing .git information from this template 
        rm -rf .git

        - removing the .git info is important as this is just a starter template provided by ga
        - do not need the existing git history of this project
