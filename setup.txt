Cloning the Auth Boilerplate
    - lecture uses the MEN Stack Auth Template as starter code
        - doing so allows us to have a connection established to our MongoDB Atlas, add functioning auth for our user model, and install some of the packages we will need for our app build
        -  https://git.generalassemb.ly/modular-curriculum-all-courses/men-stack-session-auth-template
    > navigate to the MEN Stack Auth Template and clone the repository
        git clone https://git.generalassemb.ly/modular-curriculum-all-courses/men-stack-session-auth-template.git open-house

        - by adding the open-house argument we're cloning the specified repo into a directory called open-house on our machines
    > cd into your renamed directory
        cd open-house
    > remove the existing .git information from this template 
        rm -rf .git

        - removing the .git info is important as this is just a starter template provided by ga
        - do not need the existing git history of this project

GitHub Setup
    > add this project to GitHub, initialize a new Git repository   
        git init
        git add .
        git commit -m "init commit"
    
    > make a new repository on GitHub named open-house
    > link your local project to your remote GitHub repo
        git remote add origin https://github.com/adampaley/open-house.git
        git push origin main
    > open project 
        code .

Install Dependencies
    > install all of the packages listed in pacakage.json
        npm i

Create Your .gitignore
    > once these files are created, add .env, package-lock.json, and node_modules to your .gitignore file
        .env
        node_modules
        pacakage-lock.json

Create Your .env
    - create MONGODB_URI and SESSION_SECRET to hold values used in our auth logic
        - MONGODB_URI will connect to your MongoDB Atlas connection string
        - SESSION_SECRET will aid in your auth session logic 
    > add .env file and add the following secret keys
        MONGODB_URI=
        SESSION_SECRET=
    > start the server
        nodemon start
