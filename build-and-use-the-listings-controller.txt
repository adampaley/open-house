Building the Listings Controller 
    - we are still on the user story
        As a user, I want to create listings for my real estate properties, to advertise them to potential buyers or renters.

    - however, we need to do some more prep work before we can create a listing
    > create our controller by creating a router, import the listings model, and export the router so that we can mount it in our server.js file

    > create a new file in our controllers directory called listings.schema
        // controllers/listings.js

        const express = require('express');
        const router = express.Router();

        const Listing = require('../models/listing');

        module.exports = router;

    > once our route is exported, we can import into our server.js file 
        // server.js

        // other require statements for libraries above
        const authController = require('./controllers/auth.js');
        // add listings controller:
        const listingsController = require('./controllers/listings');

        // . . .

        app.use('/auth', authController);
        // mount listings controller
        app.use('/listings', listingsController);
