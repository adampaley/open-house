Navigation Bar 
    - will need to build a few more routes to handle the creation of a listing
    > create a navigation bar so that we can easily navigate between the different pages of our application
    - going to be leveraging partials to build our page
        - partials are a way to break up our views into smaller pieces, which help keep our code DRY and make it easier to maintain
    > create a new directory called partials in the views directory
    > inside partials, create a file called _navbar.ejs 
    > inside of _navbar.ejs, create the HTML for our navbar that includes anchor tages for sign up, sign in, sign out, listings
        <!-- partials/_navbar.ejs -->

        <nav>
          <a href="/listings">View all Listings</a>
          <a href="/auth/sign-out">Sign Out</a>
          <a href="/auth/sign-up">Sign Up</a>
          <a href="/auth/sign-in">Sign In</a>
        </nav>

    - the application should only show navbar links relevant to the user (if user is signed in, do not want sign up or sign in | gues should not be able to view listings)
    > conditionally render our navbar links
        <!-- partials/_navbar.ejs -->

        <nav>
          <% if (user) { %>
            <a href="/listings">View all Listings</a>
            <a href="/auth/sign-out">Sign Out</a>
          <% } else { %>
            <a href="/auth/sign-up">Sign Up</a>
            <a href="/auth/sign-in">Sign In</a>
          <% } %>
        </nav>
