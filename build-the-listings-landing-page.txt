Route for GET All Listings 
    - before creating a listing, we will need a route to display all of the listings
    - this way, we can redirect users to the listings page after they create a new listing 

    - can determine that we need a GET request to /listings, this will be our index page for listings

        Action | What It Does          | HTTP Verb | Route
        Index  | Displays all listings | GET       | /listings

        - the index action is one of two read actions in CRUD
        - it is used to display all of the resources of a given type

You Do: Log All Listings
    - we have determined that we need a route for GET requests /listings
    > let's build them inside controller/listings.js
        1. create a route for GET requests /listings
        2. using the Listing model, find all listings
        3. console.log() the listings
        4. res.send() a message that says "Listings index page"
        5. console.log() any errors that occur 
        6. test your route in the broswer by going to localhost:3000/listings manually
            - make sure you have started your server with nodemon before testing your route 
            - after completing the above steps, should see the message "Listings index page" in the broswer
            - should see an empty array in ther terminal because no listings

Rendering the Listings Index Page
    - have confirmed that our route is working, now it's time to render the listings index page
    > create a new directory called listings in our views directy, and within that make an index.ejs
    > add the following code to new views/listings/index.ejs 
        <!-- views/listings/index.ejs -->

        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html lang="en">
          <head>
